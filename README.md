8. There will be part marking.

Letâ€™s revisit the refrigerator servicing problem from your last worksheet. The servicing facility can handle just one refrigerator at a time. Suppose that on a particular day there are n refrigerators awaiting repair. Arrival of refrigerator i is specified by a start time si, and a processing time pi. We consider that at any time repairing of a refrigerator can be suspended and then completed later.

t = 0

while there are jobs left not completely scheduled

â€¢ Among those jobs Ji such that si â‰¤ t

â€¢ increment t

The greedy algorithm that works in this case is as follows:

An efficient implementation of this greedy algorithm can be achieved by the scheduler maintaining a priority queue of jobs waiting to be scheduled (all jobs that have arrived and have not finished, minus the currently executing job if any). Each job is identified by a 4-tuple h jobId, startTime, jobLength, remLengthi, where

â€¢ jobId is a unique integer id for the job, 1 â‰¤ jobId â‰¤ n, where n is the total number of jobs

â€¢ startTime is the time (integer) at which the job is submitted (si in description), 0 â‰¤ startTime

â€¢ jobLength is the time duration for which the job will run on the processor (pi is description)

â€¢ remLength is the remaining time for which the job will run on the processor. Initially, remLength = jobLength for any job. As the job runs, remLength is decremented, until it becomes 0, at which point the job is said to have finished.

When a job is executed on the processor, its remLength value is decremented by 1 after each timestep (giving the remaining time to finish the job). When the currently executing job finishes (remLength value 0), the scheduler removes the job with the least remLength value from the queue and schedules it to run on the processor (this job now becomes the currently executing job). When a new job x arrives, its job duration is checked with the remLength value of the currently executing job y. Two cases are possible:

â€“ If the job duration of x is less than the remLength value of y, y (with its current remLength value) is added to the scheduling queue and x becomes the currently executing job (i.e, the processor is taken off from y and given to x; y will finish later when it gets the processor again as per the policy).

â€“ Otherwise, x is added to the scheduling queue.

If there are two jobs with the same remLength value, the one with the lower job id is to be chosen. The turnaround time of a job is the time taken to actually start the job, which is equal to the time at which it starts running on the processor for the first time minus its startTime value.

Part 1: Implement the scheduling queue

In this part, you will implement the scheduling queue as a priority queue using the array implementation of a heap (start from index 1 in the array). Assume that the maximum number of jobs is 99. First define a type to represent a job as follows:

#define MAX_SIZE 100 typedef struct _job { int jobId; int startTime; int jobLength; int remLength; } job; typedef struct _heap { job list[MAX_SIZE]; int numJobs; } heap;

Then, implement the following functions:

void initHeap(heap *H): initializes the heap pointed to by H (just sets numJobs to 0) void insertJob(heap *H, job j): inserts the job j in the heap pointed to by H int extractMinJob(heap *H, job *j): If the heap is empty, returns -1; Otherwise deletes the minimum element from the heap, sets *j to it, and returns 0

Part 2: Implement the scheduler

The scheduler is implemented as a function

void scheduler(job jobList[], int n)

The function takes as parameter a list of n jobs in an array jobList[], and schedules them according to the policy specified earlier.

The function prints the job ids of the jobs running on the processor for every timestep till all jobs are finished. It also prints the average turnaround time of the jobs at the end.

Your function should run in O(nlgn + T) time, where T is the sum of the job durations of all the jobs.

Main function

Your main function should do the following:

â€¢ Read the number of jobs n

â€¢ Dynamically allocate an array of n job structures

â€¢ Read the jobId, startTime, and jobLength values of each job (exactly in this order) one by one in the array

Sample output:

Enter no. of jobs (n): 4 Enter the jobs:

1 0 21

2 1 3

3 2 6

4 3 2

Jobs scheduled at each timestep are:

1 2 2 2 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Average Turnaround Time is 1.25

Note that the individual turnaround times for the jobs are 0, 0, 4 and 1, respectively. The jobs need not be sorted in any order. If you need to sort in any order, you should use counting sort. Assume all ranges are of the order of the input.

Part 3: Implement a modified scheduler

Now suppose that all the jobs are not independent, and there exist some pairs of jobs (x,y) such that if job x finishes before y starts, it can reduce the running time (remLength value) of y by 50%, if it has not started yet. We call such a pair a job-dependency pair. You can assume that there can be O(n) such pairs given. Note that the relationship is one way only, y depends on x does not imply x depends on y, so (x,y) and (y,x) are different pairs.

You can represent each such job-dependency pair by the structure

typedef struct _jobPair { int jobid_from; int jobid_to;

} jobpair;

void initHeap(newheap *H): initializes the heap void insertJob(newheap *H, job j): same as earlier int extractMinJob(newheap *H, job *j): same as earlier void decreaseKey(newheap *H, int jid):

Finally write the new scheduler function

void newScheduler(job jobList[], int n, jobpair pairList[], int m)}:

takes a list of n jobs in the array jobList and a list of m job-dependency pairs in the array pairList as parameter, and schedules the jobs. main() function:

Your main function should do the following:

â€¢ Read the number of jobs n

â€¢ Dynamically allocate an array of n job structures

â€¢ Read the jobId, startTime, and jobLength values of each job (exactly in this order) one by one

â€¢ Read the number of dependency-pairs m

â€¢ Dynamically allocate an array of m jobpair structure to store the m job-dependency pairs

â€¢ Read the job-dependency pairs one by one

Sample output:

Enter no. of jobs (n): 4 Enter the jobs:

1 0 21

2 1 3

3 2 6

4 3 2

Enter the number of dependency pairs

1

Enter the dependency pairs

2 3

Jobs scheduled at each timestep are:

1 2 2 2 4 4 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Average Turnaround Time is 1.25

Note here that since job 2 is finished before job 3 starts, the job 3 is run only for 3 timesteps. However, the turnaround times still remain the same.
